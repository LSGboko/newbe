You have been ushered into a new        life entirely, since the day you believed in Christ and        that His death on the Cross of Calvary was to take        away your sins and save you. Having repented from        your  sins  and  confessed  Him  as  your  Lord  and        Saviour by surrendering the control of your life to        Him, you have been born again.         Your first birth into this world gave you the natural        human  life,  but  this  second  birth  (the  new  birth)        gives you a spiritual birth in Christ Jesus. You have        now become a child of God. (Jn1:12).   And you are        welcome into the family of God.","Page 4         The kingdom of God is now yours (Jn  3:  3-6).  You        are no more the person you used to be. There is a        great change inside of you now.              e shall now examine what happens when anyone              becomes born again.          2Cor.  5:17  “Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he             is  a  new  creature:  old  things  have  passed             away; behold all things are become new.              1. “Old things . . .” 2Cor.5:17.         What are these old things that have passed away?        You need a clear understanding of what God has        accomplished  in  your  life  to  maximize  what  has        already occured!             (A) YOU WERE A SINNER BEFORE GOD, BEING           CONTINUALLY UNDER GOD’S JUDGMENT.            PS 51:5; ROM 3:23; ROM 3:5-6.        You  were  a  sinner  not  just  because  of  the  sinful        things that you did but because you were born a        sinner.  Every  man  born  naturally  by  human        parents, inherited the nature of sin and so cannot        please God.  All have sinned and come short of God’s        glory. The wrath of God had kept hanging on your        life  because  of  this,  even  if  you  had  actually  not","What God Did IN You               Page 5         begun  to  commit  sin.  You  were  not  a  sinner        because you sinned; you actually had no alternative        to committing sin because you were born a sinner.            (B) BEING ENSLAVED BY SIN AND SINFUL HABITS,           YOU WERE UNABLE TO PLEASE GOD.           ROM8:8-9; JN8:34; 1COR2:14; ISA 59:1-2.        Anyone who sins is a slave of sin, is bound to sin        and  is  unable  to  please  God.  It  is  sin  that  brings        separation between God and man. As a servant of        sin, you were bound to commit sin by nature.           (C) YOU WERE IN DARKNESS UNDER THE           DOMINION OF SATAN.           1JN 5:19; 2COR 4:4; PROV 4:19; JN 3:19-20.        All sinners are under the kingdom and control of        Satan. He keeps them in darkness so that even if        they  stumble  they  would  not  know  what  makes        them  to  stumble.  He  blinds  and  covers  people’s        minds  so  that  they  will  not  see  the  light  of  the        gospel  of  Christ  and  be  free.  That  was  your        condition before now.             2. “ .  .  .  have passed away”         2Cor. 5:17 says, old things have passed away; not        that they are passing away. How did it happen?","Page 6            (A) YOUR SINS ARE FORGIVEN.           PROV 28:13; 1JN 1:9; EPH 1:7; HEB 8:12.        God is faithful, just and merciful. Having confessed        your sins to Him, He has forgiven you. No matter        how terrible your sins have been, He has had mercy        on you and forgiven you as He promised.            (B) YOU HAVE BEEN CLEANSED BY THE BLOOD           OF JESUS CHRIST. 1JN 1:7; HEB 9:13-14,22.        Soap and water cannot wash away sin. Neither can        the blood of bulls, goats and rams. Having come to        believe  in  Christ  and  having  come  to  Him  for        forgiveness, you have been cleansed by the blood        He shed for you at Calvary.             (C) YOU ARE NOW DECLARED “NOT GUILTY,”           i.e. YOU ARE NOW JUSTIFIED BEFORE GOD.           ROM3:24-25(NIV,LB), ROM5:10.           “And are justified freely by His grace through             the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.”             Rom 3:24 (NIV).          “Yet  now  God  declares  us  “not  guilty”  of             offending  Him  if  we  trust  in  Jesus  Christ             who in His kindness freely takes away our             sins.” Rom 3:24 (LB).         As far as God is concerned, because of what Christ        did for you on the cross in taking your punishment","What God Did IN You               Page 7         upon  Himself,  you  are  free.  You  have  been        declared “not guilty” before God. You have been        reconciled  with  God.  You  are  now  free  to  walk        closely with the Lord and serve Him with nothing        between.             (D) THE SINFUL HEART IN YOU HAS BEEN           REMOVED.           EZEK 36:25-27; ROM 6:6NLT; GAL 5:24.        There was a heart in you before now that used to        make you sin and disobey God. It is called the heart        of stone, the human nature. It is the nature you        were born with by your human parents. Now that        you  have come to Christ, it has been taken away.        Old  things  have  passed  away.  Your  old  life  has        passed away with its passions and desires!              3. “Behold all things have become new”           (2 Cor 5:17.)        Something definite has happened to you. “Behold”        means  a  definite  change  which  can  be  seen  by        people all around you, has taken place in your life.           (A) YOU NOW HAVE A NEW HEART.           EZEK 36:26; 1JN 3:9; GAL 2:20.        God has removed from you the heart of stone, the        sinful nature which loves to sin. He has replaced it","Page 8         with a new heart, an obedient heart that loves God        and  hates  sin.  He  has  put  in  you  His  own  very        nature  (seed).  This  is  what  makes  you  a  child  of        God now.            (B)  CHRIST LIVES IN YOU NOW.           GAL 2:20; 1COR6:19.         Your  old  self,  your  old  life  (nature)  has  passed        away. Christ lives in you now. And He did not come        into you as a visitor. He came to dwell in you. All        you need to do is to allow Him. Let Him talk, sleep,        wake  up,  sing,  eat  and  work  in  you.  It  is  such  a        glorious life that nothing can compare with it.            (C) GOD HAS CHANGED YOUR SPIRITUAL           LOCATION   COL 1:12-13; ROM 11:17,24.         As soon as Christ saved you, He did not leave you in        the kingdom of darkness and under the control of        Satan. And He did not just stand and command you        to move out by yourself.  He has delivered you from        the power of darkness and translated you into the        kingdom of God in the light. There in Christ, Satan        cannot reach you.         He Himself removed you and completely planted        you in His own kingdom. You are free from Satan’s        control. Whatever rules and reigns in his kingdom        cannot affect you any longer. You have been cut off        from the wild olive tree and grafted into the holy","What God Did IN You               Page 9         olive  tree  (Jesus  Christ  Himself).  You  are  free!        Hallelujah!            (D)  YOU ARE NOW A CHILD OF GOD, A NEW           CREATION, A NEW MEMBER OF THE HOUSEHOLD           OF GOD.    JN 1:12-13; 2COR 6:18; ROM8:29.        Having repented from your old ways and received        Christ into your life, you have been given the right,        the power to become a child of God. You are now        God’s  child,  a  member  of  God’s  family.  In  that        family,  Jesus  Christ  is  the  firstborn.  All  other        believers,  including  yourself,  are  brothers  and        sisters.  You  now  have  the  Almighty  God  as  your        Father. You can now call Him “Father”. Praise the        Lord !           (E) YOU ARE A CITIZEN OF HEAVEN.           PHIL 3:20; JN 17:15-16; LK 10:20; JN 14: 2-           3; REV 20:15.         Your  name  is  written  in  the  Lamb’s  book  of  life.        Though you live in this world, you are no longer of        this world. You are a citizen of heaven. Heaven is        your home and Christ is there, preparing a place for        you, Hallelujah!           (F) FROM NOW ON, YOU MUST GROW IN CHRIST.           ROM 8:29; 2PET 3:18; 1PET 2:1-2; COL 2:6-7;        You were predestined to become like Jesus. Every        baby has a potential to become great in the future","Page 10         if he grows steadily. In the same vein, as a baby in        Christ,  you  need  to  grow  in  grace  and  in  the        knowledge  of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ.  The  word  of        God is the spiritual food (milk) for your new life in        Christ Jesus. Study it prayerfully everyday.          Relate  with  your  heavenly  Father  day  by  day  in        prayer, in the study of His word and in obedience to        Him. In doing this, you will be growing in conformity        to the image of the Lord Jesus Christ.             MEMORY VERSE: 2 COR 5:17 (NKJV)             “Therefore,  if  anyone  is  in  Christ,  he  is  a             new creation; old things have passed away,             behold, all things have become new.”              CONCLUSION        All of these, God has already done for you as a true        believer. And He did it for you free of charge. You        must learn to give thanks to God for the free gift of        salvation.","What God Did IN You               Page 11              PERSONAL  ASSESSMENT           Describe  how  you  were  before  you  had  this            saving encounter with the Lord Jesus Christ.          What  changes  have  you  noticed  inside  your            heart since you became born again and as you            surrendered  to Christ?          Share  with  us  your  personal  experience  now            with Jesus Christ.","Page 12","WHAT YOU                  MUST DO               Repentance From Dead Works . . . !              mmediately  after  a  genuine  salvation            encounter with the Saviour, Jesus Christ, a child        of God is expected to start bearing fruit by his or        her life. Having been delivered from the kingdom        of darkness and translated into the kingdom of His        dear Son (Col  1:13),  the new creation life in Christ        Jesus begins.        The  lifestyle  in  the  kingdom  of  God  is  quite        different from and opposite to the one you lived in        the kingdom of darkness. Therefore there must be        no carry-over or mixture of the two lifestyles! As        soon as the new birth takes place, the old life is        terminated and the new life begins!         But every tree is known by its fruits  (Matt  7:16).","Page 14         One of the first fruits that show the presence and        identity of the new life is the fruit of repentance.        You  cannot  be  said  to  be  born  again  until  these        fruits start manifesting in your life, Matt. 3:8 says,          “Bring  forth  therefore  fruits  meet  for             repentance” (KJV).           “Do those things that will show that you have             turned from your sins” (GNB).         Having surrendered your SELF to Christ sincerely,        confessing  your  sins  to  Him  and  receiving  His        forgiveness, we shall in this study, look at what it        means to repent and what we must  repent from.        We shall study God’s response to a “repented soul”        and the danger of refusing to repent from certain        sins. May the Lord open your eyes of understanding        and cause you to be fruitful in Jesus’ name. Amen.              1.  What Does “REPENTANCE” Mean?                a.            Dictionary Meaning:        To  repent  means  to  think  with  regret  or  sorrow        over something that one has done.","What You Must Do                        Page 15             Biblical Meaning:              b.              Prov. 28:13; Matt 3:5-8; 2Cor.7:10.        To  repent  means  to  confess  your  sins  and  to        forsake (turn from) them as a result of sorrow over        those sins. Not only that, it also involves bearing        fruits that will show that you have repented.        To confess your sins and stop sinning is not enough,        because  you  would  then  be  left  in  a  vacuum.        Having stopped sinning (i.e. having forsaken your        sins), you must start doing something else: bearing        fruits worthy of repentance.        So  there  are  three  actions  that  make  up        repentance:  Confession  of  your  sins,  forsaking  of        your  sins  and  bearing  of  fruits  to  show  that  you        have  turned  from  your  sins.    Let  us  now  look  at        what it means to repent in a little more detail.            I. REPENTANCE IS THE FIRST STEP THAT MUST BE           TAKEN TO RECONCILE WITH GOD.           Isa 59:1-2; Rom 3:23; Matt 4:17; Lk 13:1-5;           2Tim 2:19.        What separates a man from God is his sin. It is the        only  quarrel  that  man  had  with  God  from  the        beginning  of  creation.  It  becomes  necessary        therefore for each one to repent from his sins and        turn to God in order for his fellowship with God to        be restored.","Page 16         Do you desire your link with God to be restored so        that God will be for you and not against you? The        first thing to do is to repent.            II. OPPORTUNITY FOR REPENTANCE COMES           BECAUSE OF GOD’S GOODNESS AND MERCY:           Rom 2:4; 2Pet 3:9; Heb 12:16-17; Matt 9:13.         However, not everyone makes use of that privilege.        Ever before anyone makes a move to repent and        turn  to  Christ,  God  would  have  been  already  at        work  to  make  it  possible.  He  provides  the        opportunity,  removes  the  veil  and  gives        understanding  about  what  Christ  did  for  us  at        Calvary. And He is ever ready to give courage to the        sinner and encourage him/her to take the step of        faith to repent.        In His mercy, He also sends preachers to call people        to  repentance.  He  is  not  willing  that  any  should        perish, but that all should come to repentance. But        that opportunity will not be forever. It has a time        limit, though that limit is unknown.        Esau sold his birthright for a spoon of pottage. But        the  result  and  reality  of  that  action  did  not  take        place on that day until sometime later, when the        father was about to die and sent for Esau to come        and take the blessings.        The time between the day he committed the sin","What You Must Do                        Page 17         and the day he actually missed the blessing of his        father  is  a  period  of  privilege  earmarked  for        repentance.        But since he did not repent during that period of        grace,  he  lost  his  inheritance  even  though        thereafter  he  sought  for  it  diligently  later  with        tears.        Many end their lives in sin having not made use of        the opportunity and grace given them by God to        repent.  This  may  be  your  own  opportunity.  May        you  not  procrastinate  your  repentance  in  Jesus’        name.            III. IT IS NORMALLY PRECEDED BY THE ACKNOW-           LEDGEMENT OF ONE’S SINS \& SINFUL SITUATION.           Ps 32:3-5; Ps 51:3-4; Jer 3:12-13.        Without this, there can be no genuine repentance.           IV. REPENTANCE INVOLVES DEEP THOUGHT AND           SORROW OF HEART OR MOURNING OVER ONE’S           SINS.  1Kgs 21:20-29; Matt 5:4; 2Cor 7:1;           Matt 15:18-20.         As sin starts from the heart, genuine repentance        from sin also starts from the heart. It is in the heart        that  sin  is  conceived  ever  before  it  is  born.  Of        necessity,  therefore,  the  heart  must  be  touched        before  there  can  be  sincere  sorrow  leading  to        repentance.","Page 18         That  is  what  gives  rise  to  an  inner  conviction,  a        resolution  and  motivation  to  confess  and  forsake        such  sins.  Where  the  heart  is  not  touched,        repentance is not genuine.        There  may  be confession of  sins  with  the mouth        but there will be no forsaking of such sins. Is your        repentance genuine? Are you sincere?           V. REPENTANCE MAY INVOLVE WEEPING AND           FASTING.           Joel 2:12-14; Jonah 3:4-10; Lk. 7:37-38.         Anything that touches the heart of a man touches        his  emotions.  God  is  not  embarrassed  by  your        emotions as you come to Him in repentance. It may        also involve fasting.            VI. REPENTANCE INVOLVES CONFESSION WITH           ONE’S MOUTH.        It involves confession of sins, on the one hand and        confession of the Lordship of Jesus Christ over one’s        life on the other hand. Prov 28:13; Matt 3:5-8; Rom        10:9-10; Matt 9:12.        Even  though  you  sincerely  feel  sorry  from  your        heart for your sins, confession with your mouth to        the one against whom you have sinned is necessary        in order to evoke forgiveness.        This confession includes:","What You Must Do                        Page 19            (a) Confession to God              Ps 32:3-5; 1Jn 1:9; Lk 18:13; Phil 2:10-              11; Rom 10:9.        Primarily, every sin is first against God. it is against        Him that we have sinned and it is to Him we must        first  confess  our  sins  and  ask  for  forgiveness.        Secondly, recognizing Jesus Christ as Lord happens        in  the  heart  but  you  must  also  make  that        confession to God.            (b) Confession to man.  James 5:16; Lk              15:1; Matt 5:23-24; Mk 8:38; Lk 19:5-10.        Where necessary, especially where a fellow human        being  is  injured  (physically  or  spiritually),  or        offended  as  a  result  of  your  sins,  genuine        repentance  involves  confession  of  such  sins  not        only to God but also to such person(s).        God may have forgiven, but if man holds grudge        against  you,  your  prayer  will  still  be  hindered.  It        may  also  involve  restitution  as  in  the  case  of        Zacchaeus.    It  was  only  after  that  decision  to        restore  what  he  got  fraudulently,  that  Christ        declared  that  salvation  has  come  to  him  and  his        house.        It is also necessary to confess your faith in Christ        and  His  Lordship  over  your  life  before  men.  All        shame must be thrown away.","Page 20            (VII) REPENTANCE IS ONLY COMPLETE WHEN:           (a) Sin and sinful habits are completely              forsaken.  Prov. 28:13; Isa 55:7; Jn 5:14;              Tit 2:11-12.         If  you  are  sincerely  sorry  for  your  sins  then  you        should stop sinning. Grace (divine or supernatural        ability)  to  say  “no”  to  sin  comes  at  the  point  of        salvation. You are free to stop sinning now if you        have sincerely repented and received Christ.            (b) Fruits, which show repentance, are              brought forth. Matt. 3:5-8; Tit 2:11-12;              Matt 21:28-29; Eph 4:28-32.        The grace of God that brings salvation comes along        not only with the ability to say ‘no’ to sin but also        the ability to say ‘yes’ to godliness and right living. If        you  have  truly  repented,  you  will  not  only  stop        sinning but start living God’s way in obedience to        His word. That is what will show that you have truly        repented.        Repentance,  therefore,  involves  genuine  heartfelt        sorrow over your sins and sinful habits, confession        of  such sins with  your  mouth  to  God  and  where        necessary, to man.         It  may  sometimes  be  so  deep  that  it  involves        weeping  and  fasting,  not because  these  can  take","What You Must Do                        Page 21         away  sin,  but  because  weeping  is  one  way  of        expressing sorrow of heart.        However,  repentance  is  not  complete  until  sin  is        forsaken and sinful living is replaced by godly living.        Repentance  comes  from  the  heart  but  manifests        through our actions.           Can you truly say you have repented?           What is the evidence?               2. Dangers Of Covering Up And Not           Repenting From Our Sins And Dead           Works.            (A) IT RESULTS IN SEPARATION FROM GOD AND           GOD’S PRESENCE.           Isa 59:1-2; Rev 2:5; Rev 21:8; Gen 3:1-9.        Sin creates a separation, a barrier between God and        man.  As  soon  as  you  sin  whether  in  thoughts,        words or deeds and at whatever level, it cuts you        off from God’s presence automatically. Even if God        goes  ahead  to  look  for  you,  sin  would  push  you        farther  and  farther  away  from  appearing  before        God as it happened to Adam and Eve in the garden.        As  they  covered  themselves  and  their  sin  of        disobedience,  sin  pushed  them  away  from  God’s","Page 22         presence and eventually out of God’s garden, His        protection and His purpose for their lives. To repent        costs you nothing except your pride. But to cover        your  sins  will  cost  you  your  eternity  with  God  in        heaven. Please Repent.            (B) IT ATTRACTS GOD’S WRATH.   ROM 1:18;           NUM 14:11-12; LK 13:1-5; REV 2:16.        Sin attracts God’s wrath to the sinner. Each day God        sees  you  in  sin,  His  wrath  is  aroused  and  will  be        released against you if you continue in sin and die        without repenting of your sins. He sends warning        signals  which  come  in  various  ways  and  with        various calamities. It does not profit to continue in        sin. May you not harden your heart when you hear        His voice.            (C) IT  OPENS THE DOOR FOR SATAN TO ATTACK           Ecc 10:8; Jas 5:16; Jn 5:14.        As  mountains  surround  Jerusalem,  so  the  Lord        surrounds  His  people  (Ps  125:2).  But  sin  breaks        down the wall of protection and snakes (demons)        get access to attack the sinner. You cannot tell the        extent of the damage that the devil will do at any        singular opportunity. Repent from all sins and turn        to Christ. He is waiting in mercy to receive you.","What You Must Do                        Page 23           3.  Examples Of Dead Works To Be           Repented Of:           2Cor 6:16-18; 2Cor 7:1; Gal 5:19-21.         As soon as we become born again, God’s plan is to        dwell in us and walk among us. His promise is to        become a Father to every such person and have an        intimate family relationship with him. But because        God our Father is holy, we have also to be holy, not        by  personal  struggles  but  by  the  grace  made        available to us in Christ Jesus.        Repentance  is  the  first  step  in  restoring  and        maintaining  a  sweet  relationship  with  the  Lord.        Every sin and filthiness of the flesh and spirit must        be  repented  of  with  all  sincerity.  These  include        dead works and sins of the flesh that destroy the        body  (2Cor  6:16-17;  1Cor  6:18-20)  e.g.  sexual        immorality,  smoking,  friendship  with  unbelievers,        alcoholism, etc. Do not waste time in turning away        from them.            (A) IN OUR THOUGHTS.  Matt 12:24-25,31; Isa           55:6-7; Matt 5:27-28;  Matt 15:19.        There  are  certain  sins  that  do  not  express        themselves in visible action but in our thoughts, yet        God regards them as sins of no less gravity and no        less consequence than those committed physically.        They are dead works and you must repent of them.","Page 24          Wrong  thoughts  about  others,  lustful  thoughts,        impure and immoral thoughts, evil thoughts of all        kinds which often result in evil deeds are all sinful        and are capable of separating you from God.           Pause here!            What are the sins that has taken root in your           thoughts? Dig into all the recesses of your heart           and repent of them all with a sincere heart. As           you do so, you shall surely obtain mercy.            B. IN OUR WORDS.           Prov 10:19; Matt 12:36-37; Eph 4:29.         Lying, gossiping, talkativeness, idle words, abusive        words, cursing etc. are examples of sins committed        through  words.  By  your  words  you  shall  be        condemned and by your words you shall be justified.        Are you guilty of sinful speech? They are powerfully        capable of sending you to hell. Confess and forsake        them with all sincerity and the Lord will have mercy        and grant you deliverance from all such sins.           (C) IN OUR DEEDS.           Isa 55:6-7; Gal 5:19-21; Rom 1:29-32; Col           3:5-9; Matt 5:23-24; Matt 6:14-15.        The list is endless. This is just a list. What are the        wrong deeds you are personally involved in? You        know them. Anyone who does such things cannot","What You Must Do                        Page 25         inherit  the  kingdom  of  God.  You  must  repent        immediately. Whosoever covers  his sins shall not        prosper,  but  whosoever  confesses  and  forsakes        them shall obtain mercy.           MEMORY VERSE: Prov. 28:13.           “He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but             whosoever  confesseth  and  forsaketh  them             shall have mercy.             CONCLUSION        It  was  sin  that  brought  a  quarrel  and  separation        between God and man. But Jesus Christ came and        died on the cross, shedding His blood in order to        pay the price for our sins and settle the quarrel. It        is,  however,  only  by  a  sincere  and  deliberate        personal  repentance  from  our  sins  that  the        reconciliation He paid for, can become a reality in        our lives.        Repentance  is  the  first  step  to  take  in  order  to           remove the barrier between God and you.        You  may  receive  healing,  miracles  or  divine           solution to problems, but all these are acts of           God’s goodness. They do not remove the barrier           of sin between your soul and the Saviour.","Page 26         Search  your  heart  and  repent  from  every  dead        work. Enthrone the Lord in your heart and make        Him Lord in every situation of your life. You will find        a deep joy and sweet communion with the Lord.               PERSONAL ASSESSMENT             1.          We  learnt  in  this  Bible  study  that  repentance             involves  acknowledging  your  sins,  a  feeling  of            sorrow  over  your  sins  followed  by  confession  of            those sins to God and where necessary to man.                 What are  the  sins you  have truly repented                  of?  How  did  you  come  to  that  point  of                  repentance?                 (b)  Have  you  recognized  any  of  your  sins                  that  you need to confess to a fellow human                  being that you have offended? What are those                  sins? What steps have you taken to confess                  them?                 (c) As you look inside your heart, are there                  any  of  such  sins  that  you  find  difficult  to                  completely  stop  practicing,  either  in  your                  thoughts, words or action?

It is a             spiritual  matter  and  it  can  only  be  done        spiritually.  The  Lord,  who  is  the  object  of  our        pursuit, is Spirit and those who worship Him must        worship in spirit and in truth.          “The natural man does not receive the things             of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness             to  him;  nor  can  he  know  them,  because             they  are  spiritually  discerned.  The  things             that pertain to God cannot be obtained by             natural means”  (1 Cor 2:11-15).        We  shall,  therefore,  seek  to  understand  some        practical spiritual means of pursuing and getting to        know God progressively and more intimately and        particularly to know our inheritance in Christ Jesus.        May God give you understanding. Amen.","Page 30            1.   The Word Of God         The word of God is very central in seeking to know        God. The Person of God is revealed in His word. It is        God’s means of achieving His purpose. By the word        of God, the worlds were framed (Heb.  11:3)  and by        it, God’s servants (vessels) are thoroughly furnished        for every good work (2 Tim 3:16-17).        A deep longing for, a progressive learning from and        a total submission to the word of God, is therefore        necessary in knowing God and obtaining the things        of the kingdom. This is because:            (A) IT IS THE WORD OF GOD THAT TESTIFIES           ABOUT HIM.  Jn 5:39; 2Cor 3:18; Jas 1:23-25.         Discuss  this  with  reference  to  its  importance  in        knowing God. The word of God tells us who God is.        It  acts  as  a mirror  through  which  we  behold  the        glory of the Lord, thereby showing us who God is. It        is  God’s  testimony  about  Himself  and  everything        He has made.        This mirror also shows us our own true condition. It        shows us what is wrong with our lives as well as        what is required of us.  As He reveals His will to us        by His Word, we are continuously changed into His        likeness from one degree of glory to another. It is        therefore  necessary  for  us  to  diligently  keep","Practical Means Of Growing In Christ       Page 31        studying and looking into the perfect law of liberty        in  order  to  grow  in  our  knowledge  of  God  and        become progressively changed into His likeness as        we walk with Him.           (B)  OUR INHERITANCE IN CHRIST JESUS IS           PARCELED AND KEPT IN THE WORD OF GOD.           2Pet 1:3-4; Jn 5:39;         Check the following examples and see how what        each of them would become, was spoken in God’s        word ahead of time.                Abraham:      Gen. 12:1-3;                Jesus Christ:    Isa.  61:1-3, Luke 4:17-19                Mary:         Luke 1:26-38;                Sarah:        Gen. 18:9-10, Heb. 11:11        What  then should  your  attitude  be  towards  the        word  of  God?  For  any  believer  to  be  able  to        possess  his  possession,  he  must  pay  attention  to        what God says to him in His word.        When God was planning to make Abraham great,        He spoke to him. For Jesus Christ to be what God        wanted Him to be, He received it through the word        of God. For the virgin Mary to conceive and bring        forth  the  Savior  of  the  world  and  for  Sarah  to        conceive in her old age and to receive what God        had promised, God had to speak His word to them.        No  one  can  become  what  God  wants  him  to  be        without  paying  a  close  attention  to  the  written","Page 32        word  of  God.  Progressive knowledge  of  the  Lord        and His word is what  will make you become fit to        handle your divine inheritance.            (C)  GOD’S WORD IS GOD’S MEANS OF MAKING           (MOLDING) HIS VESSELS. 2Pet 3:18; 2Tim 3:16           -17KJV, LB; Isa 28:9-10; Acts 2:42.        The precepts upon precepts that form concepts for        living  and  for  practical  walk  with  God  are  only        found  in  the  word  of  God.    God’s  word  is  His        comprehensive  equipment  to  straighten  out  our        lives and correct every error in our hearts.        It is the light that illuminates our path in life. It is by        it  that  God’s  servant  is  instructed  and  kept  from        presumptuous  sin.  There  is  no  other  means  by        which  God  fashions  His  vessels  apart  from  His        infallible  Word.  If  you  desire  to  become  a  useful        vessel in God’s hands, you must pay attention to        whatever God says to you in His word. Take time        out to study it, listen to it, receive it, keep it in your        heart and persevere with it until it brings forth fruit        in your life (Lk 8:15).           (D)  CONSISTENT AND PROGRESSIVE STUDY OF           GOD’S WORD IS A NECESSITY IN SEEKING THE           KINGDOM OF GOD AND HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS.           Josh 1:8; Rom 10:17; Neh 8:1-16; Dan 9:1-2;           Isa 5:13-14. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?  DISCUSS.         Neglecting to study the word of God will only result","Practical Means Of Growing In Christ       Page 33         in the lack of the knowledge of God. This in turn will        cause hell and the devil to enlarge themselves in        your life.        Many  people  suffer  unnecessary  hardships  today        from man and the devil because they do not know        God enough as to be able to know what steps to        take in time of need. They run from pillar to post,        being tossed to and fro by every wind of doctrine        and false teachers take advantage of this and make        a living out of their lives.        To prosper in life and in the purpose of God, you        must be a consistent student (a learner) of the Holy        Scriptures  as  faith  comes  by  hearing  and  hearing        the word of God. A consistent study, meditation in        and understanding of the word of God, will make        the  kingdom  of  God  and  His  righteousness  to        progress in your life.              2.   Prayer        This  is  another  important  means  of  pursuing  the        knowledge of God and for obtaining things in the        kingdom  of  God.  Prayer  means  communing  with        God. We speak to God and God speaks to us in the        place of prayer. Ex  31:18;  Lk  11:1-13;  Dan  6:10;        1Thes5:17; Isa 26:3 (GNB,LB).","Page 34            (A) BY PRAYER, OUR KNOWLEDGE OF GOD IS           ENHANCED.  Ex 33:12-23. DISCUSS THIS.            (B) BY PRAYER, WE MAKE OUR REQUESTS           KNOWN TO GOD. Phil 4:6-7; Jas 4:2; 1Sam           1:10-12. What does that imply?        This  gives  us  opportunity  to  know  Him  and        experience Him as He answers our prayers. Hannah        neither quarreled with Peninnah nor retaliated the        vexation  with  which  she  vexed  her  sore  because        she was barren. She prayed and made her request        known to God. The Lord answered her prayer and        gave her a son. This became a great experience of        God for her, and this is clearly written in 1Sam 2:1-10.           (C)  BY PRAYER , WE PURSUE THE PURPOSE OF           GOD FOR OUR LIVES.           Lk 3:21-22; Lk 6:12-13; Lk 2:36-38; Dan           6:10; Dan 9:2-7,19; Eph 6:18.        The men and women of old sought God’s face in        prayer to understand and fulfill God’s purpose for        their  lives.  As God’s purpose becomes fulfilled in        our lives, our knowledge of Him is enhanced.        Prayer is not something to be taken  lightly at all in        our pursuit of the knowledge of God. No one can        grow in the grace and knowledge of God without        relating  consistently  with  God  in  the  place  of        prayer. Even for our Lord Jesus Christ, praying was","Practical Means Of Growing In Christ       Page 35         His personal lifestyle. It must also be our way of life        if we must succeed in our pursuit of God and His        purpose for our lives.              3.   Fasting            (a) FASTING MEANS ABSTAINING FROM FOOD OR               OTHER PLEASURES FOR A PERIOD OF TIME               FOR KINGDOM PURPOSE.  Matt 4:1-2; Lk               4:1-2; Dan 9:2-3; Dan 10:3.        Fasting is not done arbitrarily. It is often combined        with prayer so that the purpose of engaging in it        can be achieved. Mk 9:29; Neh 1:3-4; Dan 9:2-4; Dan 10:1-5.             I          is a very important means of knowing God            t            and experiencing Him.  Matt  4:1-2;  Lk  5:34-            35; Joel  1:13-14; Dan 9:2-3; Isa 58:6-9; Lk            2:37; Acts 10:30.        Discuss this in line with the above Scriptures.        Fasting  helps  to  make  us  spiritually  sensitive.  It        helps to make our hearts concentrate on the Lord        as we seek to know Him.        The  elders  who  have  gone  ahead  of  us  pursued        God and His purpose with prayer and fasting and        great  exploits  were  done  by  their  hands.  We        cannot do less and expect the same results.","Page 36            4. Practical  Obedience To God’s  Word         This is another crucial means of knowing God.           Ex 19:5; Isa 1:19; Isa 66:2(b); Jn 15:7; Phil           2:8-11; Heb 5:7-8; Gen 12:1-4; Acts 4:18-           20; Acts 5:29; Heb 3:17-18 (NIV).        Growth in life and in the knowledge of God comes        as  we  obey  Him.  Obedience  to  the  Lord  and  His        word  gives  us  practical  experience  and  spiritual        maturity. As we walk in obedience to God’s word,        the  Lord  is  drawn  towards  us.  Promotion  also        comes to us as we make obedience our lifestyle.        Even  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  had  to  prove  Himself        perfect in obedience before He became the Author        of  eternal  salvation  to  those  who  obey  Him.        Obedience  is  an  important  key  to  progress  in        knowing God.              5. Fellowship With Other Believers         This  is  yet  another  important  means  of  knowing        God. Even tough we have been called by God into        the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, yet        there are many FELLOWS in this same SHIP.   1Cor        1:9; Eph 2:18-19; Eph 4:4-6.","Practical Means Of Growing In Christ       Page 37         What do you understand by this?           (B) UNITY, PROGRESS AND KINGDOM TREASURES           ARE RELEASED TO US AS WE FELLOWSHIP  WITH           OTHER BELIEVERS  Ps 133:1-3; Dan 2:13-19;           Acts 2:41-43; Heb 10:24-25; 1Jn 1:3.        Discuss how this happens practically?        As we share our lives, experiences and possessions        with other believers and others also share with us,        our knowledge of God increases. God sometimes        reveals Himself to us through other believers. We        are  members  of  one  another  and  we  are        dependent on one another.        You cannot be doing things to tamper with  your        fellowship with other believers and think that God        will have fellowship with you. You cannot be a good        child of God when you are a bad brother or sister to        His other  children.        We have one God and are members of one Body.        Our fellowship with other believers enhances our        fellowship with God. In your  pursuit of God,  you        must  pursue  genuine  fellowship  with  other        Christians,  endeavoring  to  keep  the  unity  of  the        Spirit  in  the  bond  of  peace.  It  is  an  important        means of knowing God.","Page 38            6.   Discipleship         This is yet another very crucial means of pursuing        the knowledge of God and obtaining the treasures        of the kingdom.           (A)  GOD DOES NOT COMMIT ETERNAL           TREASURES INTO THE HANDS OF BABES.           GEN 2:8; EX 2:14; GAL 4:1-4; ISA 28:9; MK 4:11.        Kingdom treasures such as the knowledge of God,        the  mysteries  of  the  kingdom  and  our  divine        inheritance  are  only  handed  over  to  people  who        have been formed (made, moulded), people who        have quit childish  things.  Many men and women        today  are  babes  in  their  thoughts  and  actions        because  they  are  not  committed  to  the  Lord  in        discipleship. If God will reveal Himself to you and        hand over your own inheritance in Christ to you,        you have a need to . . .          (i) submit your daily life and direction to following in            the footsteps of the Lord Jesus in thought, word            and deed . . . and then also . . .           (ii)  submit  to  the  moulding  hands  of  tutors,            trustees,  guardians  and  even  the  fellowship  of            believers in discipleship relationships that helps you            follow the Master.","Practical Means Of Growing In Christ       Page 39            (B)   MEN AND WOMEN OF OLD WHO MADE GOD           THEIR PURSUIT, ALSO WALKED ON THIS SAME           PATH OF DISCIPLESHIP.           RUTH 1:15-17; 1SAM 3:1-11; MATT 11:28-40;           4:19-22; MK 3:13-15; MATT 5:1-2; 10:1, 5;           20:21; ACTS 1:14; ACTS 6:1-3.        Discipleship is God’s method of making His men. It        is as you willingly and submissively learn of Christ        under the hands of more matured Christians that        your own inheritance will be handed over to you,        since in discipleship you have the privilege of being        tried, trimmed and approved.           CONCLUSION         Seeking to know God is not done arbitrarily. God        has His own way of doing things. It takes God to        reveal  Himself  to  a  man  before  he  can  gain  an        intimate  knowledge  of  Him.  He  will  not  reveal        Himself unless you seek Him with all your heart.        These  means  are  God’s  means  and  provisions  to        place your feet on the path of knowing Him. You        cannot pursue the things of the kingdom of God in        your own way and hope to achieve God’s kind of        results. At the end you will only be like one who has        been shadow – boxing , running aimlessly.         Your  life  would  have  been  spent  in  vain.  If  your        desire is to pursue the knowledge of God and have        Him as your portion of inheritance, you must pay","Page 40         attention to His own means of achieving His own        purpose.  Each  of  these  means  will  push  you  a        distance in knowing God, if you apply yourself to        them with all diligence.
